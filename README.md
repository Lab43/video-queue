## To Do:
* debounce window scroll event
* better responsive scaling of vertical spacing
* better error handling
* prevent the same video from being added multiple times
* add tip about being able to boookmark page
* experiment with filling logo with texture
* make texture respond to pixel density
* add feedback/animation when video is deleted, so it's clearer what just happend
* Change placeholder text to "Enter another YouTube or Vimeo URL here" after first video has been added
* make footer not so ugly
  * possibly, change to theme color
* deal with favicons and apple icons
