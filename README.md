## To Do:
* debounce window scroll event
* prevent the same video from being added multiple times
* add tip about being able to boookmark page
* add feedback/animation when video is deleted, so it's clearer what just happend
* Change placeholder text to "Enter another YouTube or Vimeo URL here" after first video has been added
* deal with favicons and apple icons
* license information
* do cross browser testing, remove conditional html class if necessary
* social graph stuff (facebook image, description, etc.)

## Bugs:
* If you resize the window, the url form with switch to fixed at the wrong scroll point
